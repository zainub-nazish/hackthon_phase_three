# Specification Quality Checklist: Chat UI (Frontend)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: [specs/006-chat-ui/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) in user stories
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- FR-004 mentions `POST /api/{user_id}/chat` which is an API contract reference (acceptable as it defines integration boundary, not implementation).
- Assumptions section documents dependency on Spec-5 Chat API being available.
- All 17 functional requirements are testable with clear MUST language.
- All 6 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.
- All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.
